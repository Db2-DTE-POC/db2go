    "All of the Db2 GO functions either return an error code, or a value, followed by an error code. A typical API call will have the following syntax:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "value, error = db.function(parameters,...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three fields that are usually present in a call:\n",
    "* value - An object or value being retrieved by the function\n",
    "* error - The error status\n",
    "* db - An identifier or object that the function is being performance against\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the function is being executed against a database, then the identifier `db` is expected to be a handle, or pointer to the database object that would have been created earlier in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all examples, the `error` field will contain `nil` if the function succeeded, otherwise it will be a non-null value. All functions should be followed by logic to trap any errors that occur with the function call:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "db, error := sql.Open(\"go_ibm_db\",*connStr);\n",

    "# Database Connections\n",
    "Before you begin issuing any SQL commands, you must first establish a connection to a database. Then `Open` function is used to establish a connection to the database and it returns a database handle. The database handle will be used for subsequent calls to the database. In the event the connection was not successful, an error message and code will be returned to the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you have finished the application or transaction, you should close the connection handle with the `Close` function. If your program exits before issuing a `Close` command, there is always a possibility that the transaction will continue to be active in the Db2 database until a timeout occurs. To avoid situations where you exit the program without a `Close`, you can use the following Go syntax to fire the `Close` function at function exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "db, error = Open(...)\n",
    "if (error == nil) {\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the `if` block to check to see if a valid connection was returned. Otherwise, the `db.Close` function will cause an error on exit because there is no valid connection. Usually your application would have issued an error message about a bad connection in the body of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more traditional way of closing a database connection (Python, C, Java, etc...) would be to have the `Close` statement at the bottom of the code. This approach will also work but requires that any error situation will need to issue the `Close` statement, while the `defer` approach only requires one `Close` statement."

    "# Commit Scope\n",
    "When a database like Db2 **commits** work, it means that the data has been hardened into the database. The changes are made to the underlying tables and you cannot **undo** the work. The default behavior for Db2 connections is **AUTOCOMMIT** which implies that every successful statement execution will have the work commited to the database. This behavior may be appropriate for some types of database calls (i.e. CREATE a table), but may not be correct when dealing with a financial transaction. A typical example would be to take money from one account and move it to another. If you commited the withdrawal (debit) on the first account and committed it, and the second part of the transaction (credit) failed, you would end up with inconsistent data and an unhappy customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these inconsistent situations, databases have the concept of commit scopes. You need to **begin** a transaction and then issue all of your INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements as required. Once you have completed all of the steps, you will then issue a **COMMIT** statement to update all tables involved in the transaction. If there was an issue with the transaction, you could issue a **ROLLBACK** and remove all of the changes that were done and leave the tables in the same state as when you started the transaction. The other benefit of using transactions is that the database guarantees that your data will not change during the duration of your transaction. No other user will be able to update the data while you manipulating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commit scope is always connected to a transaction handle, not the database. You are committing the work done by the transaction and so the `Commit` and `Rollback` refer to the transaction handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a Go perspective, your code would look similar to the following:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "db, error = Open(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "tx, error = db.Begin()\n",
    "\n",
    "... do some work...\n",
